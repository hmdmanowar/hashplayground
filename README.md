# Jarvis

An independent, model-agnostic AI agent runtime. Jarvis is a standalone product — it is not a feature of Hash Playground or any other single application. Other apps will eventually consume it through a stable interface (SDK/API), not by importing its internals.

This repo has no dependency on, and must never import from, the Hash Playground codebase.

## Status: v0.1 (Foundation + Brain) + Phase 2 (Memory) + Phase 3 (Tools) + Phase 4 (Agent) + Phase 5 (Vision) + Phase 6 (Autonomous Developer) + a full web UI

Done:
- Standalone TypeScript project, own git repo
- `AIModel` provider abstraction (`src/models/AIModel.ts`)
- One local model connected via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (`src/models/OllamaModel.ts`)
- Basic multi-turn conversation (`src/core/Jarvis.ts`)
- Short-term (in-process) conversation memory (`src/memory/ShortTermMemory.ts`)
- **Persistent, user-controlled long-term memory** (`src/memory/LongTermMemory.ts`) — SQLite-backed (Node's built-in `node:sqlite`, no extra dependency), with keyword-overlap relevance retrieval fed back into every chat turn. Only written when you explicitly ask via `/remember` — never auto-extracted.
- **Real tools, sandboxed, behind an enforced Permission Engine** (`src/tools/`, `src/permissions/PermissionEngine.ts`) — `read_file`, `list_directory`, `write_file`, `search_code`, and `run_command`, all confined to a workspace root (`.jarvis/workspace/` by default) that no path can escape. Each tool has a fixed risk level (low/medium/high); low and medium run automatically, high (currently just `run_command`) always requires you to `/approve` or `/deny` it first. Every action — automatic or approved — is written to an append-only audit log (`.jarvis/audit.log`).
- **Multi-step agent loop** (`src/core/Jarvis.ts`) — the model can chain several tool calls toward a goal within one turn (e.g. "list the workspace, then read hello.txt and summarize it"), instead of needing a separate prompt per step. Bounded by a per-turn step cap (`maxAgentSteps`, default 5, `JARVIS_MAX_AGENT_STEPS`) — not open-ended autonomy or a background loop (that's Phase 8). A high-risk step in the middle of a plan still pauses for `/approve`/`/deny`, and approving resumes the same plan with its remaining step budget rather than starting over. `jarvis.getLastTrace()` returns the tool/outcome sequence for the most recent turn. The tool-call parser only ever executes the first well-formed call in a reply and discards anything after it — live testing against the local model showed it can sometimes string multiple `TOOL_CALL` lines together or fabricate fake results in trailing text instead of stopping after one call as instructed, so the loop treats only the first call as real and lets the model see the genuine result next.
- **Vision** (`src/core/Jarvis.ts`, `visionModel` option) — a second Ollama model (`llava` by default, `JARVIS_VISION_MODEL`) used only for a turn that attaches an image; the default text model stays in charge of everything else. Images persist with their conversation (`src/memory/ConversationStore.ts`). Once an image has ever been sent, later plain-text turns strip images out of the history sent to the non-vision model — Ollama hard-errors on any request carrying `images` for a model that doesn't support them, even on a message that isn't the current turn.
- Persistent configuration via `.env` (`src/config/config.ts`)
- Tests (using a mock model, no Ollama dependency) and a CLI to try it for real (`/image <path>` attaches an image to your next message)
- A local HTTP API (`src/api/server.ts`, 127.0.0.1 only, no auth) and a full React web UI (`web/`) — multi-conversation history, message timestamps/copy/share/edit, image attachments, and a voice assistant (speech-to-text with auto-submit, auto-speak replies, a "Hey `<assistant name>`" wake word, barge-in on "stop", and hands-free multi-turn conversation until a goodbye phrase) built entirely on free browser Speech APIs — no external voice service. A small client-side command matcher also lets phrases like "delete this conversation" or "disable voice assistant" act on the UI directly rather than going through the model.
- **Autonomous Developer** (`src/tools/RepoTools.ts`, `GitTools.ts`, `DevTools.ts`) — a second tool root, `repoRoot` (defaults to the process's cwd, override via `JARVIS_REPO_ROOT`), separate from the disposable `workspaceRoot` sandbox: Jarvis can inspect, edit, branch, checkpoint, and test its own real repository. `repo_read_file`/`repo_list_directory`/`repo_search_code`/`repo_status`/`repo_log`/`repo_diff`/`repo_run_tests` are low risk (automatic); `repo_write_file`/`repo_create_branch`/`repo_checkout_branch`/`repo_commit`/`repo_run_build` are medium (also automatic, reviewable afterward via `repo_diff`/`repo_status`/`.jarvis/audit.log`); `repo_reset` (hard reset to a ref — the one destructive, history-discarding op) is high risk and always requires `/approve`. Git tool calls spawn `git` with an argv array rather than a shell string, and branch names/refs are validated against a safe pattern, so there's no way for a value to be reinterpreted as a flag or shell syntax. `ToolRegistry` now takes `(workspaceRoot, repoRoot)` and fails fast if `repoRoot` isn't a git repository.

Not started yet (later phases, in the order planned): multi-agent roles and 24/7 autonomous operation (Phase 8).

## Setup

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and make sure it's running.
2. Pull the default model, and the vision model if you want image support:
   ```
   ollama pull qwen2.5-coder
   ollama pull llava
   ```
3. Install dependencies (also installs the `web/` frontend, via npm workspaces):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (defaults already work; only edit it if you're using a different host/model, want the assistant to introduce itself under a different name via `JARVIS_NAME`, or want the memory database, tool sandbox, or audit log somewhere other than `.jarvis/`):
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Usage

**CLI:**
```
npm run chat
```
Interactive REPL. Ctrl+C to quit. Commands, in addition to normal chat:
- `/remember <text>` — store something permanently
- `/memories` — list everything stored, with ids
- `/forget <id>` — delete one
- `/approve` / `/deny` — resolve a pending high-risk tool request (e.g. after asking Jarvis to run a shell command)
- `/image <path>` — attach a local image file to your next message (routes that turn to the vision model)

**Web UI:** two terminals —
```
npm run api       # backend on http://127.0.0.1:4000
npm run web:dev   # frontend, Vite will print the URL (default http://localhost:5173)
```
The same commands above work by just typing them into the chat box — there's no separate memory or approval UI yet.

## Development

```
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # vitest — does not require Ollama running
npm run build       # compile to dist/
```

## Architecture

```
src/
  config/       persistent configuration (.env)
  models/       AIModel interface + provider implementations (Ollama today; OpenAI/Claude/Gemini later)
  memory/       short-term (in-process) history + long-term (SQLite) memory
  tools/        concrete, sandboxed tools (filesystem, search, terminal) scoped to workspaceRoot,
                plus repo-scoped tools (file/git/build-test) scoped to repoRoot, + the registry
                that describes them all to the model
  permissions/  PermissionEngine — risk classification, auto-approve policy, and the
                append-only audit log
  core/         Jarvis orchestrator — wires config + model + memory + tools; handleInput() is
                the shared entry point for every interface (/remember, /memories, /forget,
                /approve, /deny)
  cli/          interactive chat REPL
  api/          local HTTP API (127.0.0.1 only)
  index.ts      public exports — the future SDK surface
web/            React + Vite chat frontend (own package.json/tsconfig, npm workspace)
```

`core/Jarvis.ts` depends only on the `AIModel` interface, never on a concrete provider — swapping or adding a model provider later means writing one new file under `models/`, not touching the core. Both the CLI and the API call `jarvis.handleInput()` rather than duplicating command parsing.

Tool-calling is a self-defined convention (`TOOL_CALL: {"tool": "...", "args": {...}}`, described to the model in the system prompt and parsed back out of its reply), not Ollama's native function-calling API — testing showed the default `qwen2.5-coder` doesn't reliably support that. This is also more portable: it works the same way regardless of which model is swapped in behind `AIModel`.
